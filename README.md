This repository consists of

* **R-visualization-with-ggplot2.ipynb** - A basic guide to data visualization in R with ggplot2

* **Python-simple-scatter-plots-with-matplotlib.ipynb** - A sample python notebook from Python Data Science Handbook [Github](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)

* **email-campaign.R** - An R code example, meant to show the capabilities of binder running rstudio. Once your binder container is up, from the New drop-down choose Rstudio as shown in the image below. Or, simply click on this launch button to go directly to RStudio [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/soltaniehha/Sample-R-and-Python-notebooks-with-binder/master?urlpath=rstudio)
